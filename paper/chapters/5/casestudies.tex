\chapter{The Student Perspective}

After having gained insight on why and how educators use GitHub to augment their classes, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of using such a system from the instructor perspective. From the interviews conducted with various educators, the instructors explaiend multiple benefits such as the ability to better monitor student work and the ease in which they can reuse and remix course material from other instructors. However, they noted other benefits which have impact on their students, benefits such as the relevance of GitHub to the careers of the students and that using GitHub allowed them to encourage students to participate in changing the course material or discussing artifacts in the course like deadlines. Having heard these potential benefits to students, I decided to pursue that direction and see, firstly, how students feel about the current learning platforms and tools used in their classes, and then explore their perspective on GitHub as such a platform.
