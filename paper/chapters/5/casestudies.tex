\chapter{The Student Perspective}

After having gained insight on why and how educators use GitHub to augment their classes, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of using such a system from the instructor perspective. From the interviews conducted with various educators, the instructors explaiend multiple benefits such as the ability to better monitor student work and the ease in which they can reuse and remix course material from other instructors. However, they noted other benefits which have impact on their students, benefits such as the relevance of GitHub to the careers of the students and that using GitHub allowed them to encourage students to participate in changing the course material or discussing artifacts in the course like deadlines. Having heard these potential benefits to students, I decided to pursue that direction and see, firstly, how students feel about the current learning platforms and tools used in their classes, and then explore their perspective on GitHub as such a platform. We felt from that work that GitHub could, in the future, serve as

The result was to conduct a study in which GitHub in ways similar to Learning Management Systems, where the instructor would disseminate material and the students would have discussions on GitHub. Few studies exist that explore the student perspective of tools used in higher education and learning management systems beyond usability. In this instance, my questions were more exploratory as I wanted to explore how students found GitHub's effectiveness as a learning platform, in the process gathering their perspective on current learning tools and platforms used in the University and how GitHub fits in with those. It was important to place a focus on the students as learning tools become more geared towards student participation and contributions, as advocated by much of the research [cite a bunch of studies from Ch2].

\section{Research Questions}
The research questions addressed during this study include:
\bigskip
How do students feel that the use of systems like GitHub can benefit their education? We've seen evidence that the use of GitHub can be beneficial in a number of ways for educators. The natural progression was to see student perceptions on this.

\bigskip
What are the challenges for students related to the use of GitHub in their classes? When adopting a new tool, particularly one not originally tailored for education, there's bound to be some friction involved. We aimed to identify these so as to make recommendations towards designing a system more suitable for education.

\bigskip
What do students feel is the ideal workflow for using GitHub in the classroom? Just as there are multiple ways to use GitHub for development purposes, an educator has multiple options regarding how the class could utilize GitHub as a tool. We aimed to learn what kind of GitHub workflow students would enjoy and deem appropriate for their classes.

\bigskip
How do students feel the GitHub approach and GitHub as a tool in comparison to more traditional Learning Management Systems? Specifically, we aimed to gain insights on student perceptions on currently used educational tools such as Learning Management Systems like Coursespaces (Moodle) and Connex (Sakai) and GitHub's potential as such a portal for student interactions with the course.

\section{Research Design}
Consistent with the study conducted with the instructors, we approached this study with a qualitative approach. As Creswell [cite Creswell 2003] suggests, a qualitative, and therefore exploratory, approach best suits research when a concept or phenomenon requires more understanding because there's little pre-existing research. Moreover, continuing with a qualitative approach to be consistent with the previous study is important because the aim was to investigate similar outcomes from the same phenomenon, but from another perspective. This also continues the constructivist approach with which the research has been conducted.

Yin [cite Yin book] introduces case studies as \"an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident\". Case study design, according to Yin, should be used when (a) the study seeks to answer \"how\" or \"why\" things happen; (b) the study is focused on the natural behavior of participants; (c) the context is important for the study; or (d) there are no clear descriptions of what is happening between \"the phenomenon and context.\" Most of these reasons apply to the nature of the research questions asked in this study, and as a result, the case study design was chosen for this work. Specifically, the study was exploratory, as it served as an early investigation on the phenomenon of GitHub in the classroom and to potentially build new theories or derive new hypotheses [cite Easterbrook et al.].

Specific to software engineering, Runeson [cite Runeson] defines case studies in software engineering as \"an empirical enquiry that draws on multiple sources of evidence to investigate one instance (or a small number of instances) of a contemporary software engineering phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the boundary between phenomenon and context cannot be clearly specified.\" In this work, we aimed to draw on muliple sources of evidence - multiple students and instructors - to investigate the phenomenon of the GitHub Way approach to classes. As well, in this instance, it was difficult to separate this phenomenon from the context of educational tools in the classroom. It's important to learn student perspectives on the context as well, so as to explore the effectiveness of introducing a tool otherwise not built for the classroom.

\subsection{Recruitment}
This study involved the main stakeholders in a course as participants: the professor, lab instructor, and students. The learning tools used in the course directly involves and impacts these stakeholders, and as such, answering our research question must involve getting their perspective and opinions on said tools. I wanted to get their perspectives while the course was ongoing, so that they may recall recent experiences and provided their opinions on GitHub as a learning tool based off those experiences.


%or is this single case with embedded units?
%http://www.nova.edu/ssss/QR/QR13-4/baxter.pdf
For this study, we were opportunistic in finding cases, seeking instructors who could and would try using GitHub, a tool not often used in university classes, for the course. We recruited a professor who wanted to try the tool, and as she taught multiple courses, it set up the study for a multiple-case design. Having multiple cases, it would allow us to explore any possible differences between the two cases, with the goal being to replicate findings across cases [cite Yin]. The two course were Distributed Systems (DS), a Computer Science course that consisted of both undergraduate and graduate students, and Software Evolution (SE), a Software Engineering course that only consisted of undergraduate students. Both classes were similar in size (30-40 students) and in learning activities (two projects, labs every week).

When the term began, I attended one of the early lectures to describe the study and to recruit students for future participation. They would sign up with their names and emails with the knowledge that participation will be voluntary and that I would only contact them if they signed up to participate. As the course was wrapping up, I attended one more lecture to recruit some more participants in the same manner.

\subsection{Data Collection}
Data collection began with a preliminary survey to the students asking them to discuss their thoughts on learning tools in general and on GitHub as a learning tool. This was distributed to all students who signed up to participate, and received x respondents from the DS course and y respondents from the SE course.

As the main means of collecting data, I would interview the participants who were happy to discuss their experiences and opinions. Interviews began midway through the semester and would continue throughout. Most interviews with the students were one-to-one; however, due to scheduling reasons, some students requested to be interviewed as a group of 2 or 3. Interviews with the students lasted 20-30 minutes and were all conducted face-to-face in a meeting room. Audio from every interview was recorded with participant consent, and I would take notes on the participant's responses for reference. The interviews were semi-structured based on 10 guiding questions and I could dig deeper with additional questions as deemed appropriate. This supported the exploratory nature of the work, and allows for discovery of interesting insights.
%citation for semi-structured interviews; runeson?

The instructors were also interviewed. The course instructor was interviewed 3 times, once at the start, once in the middle of the semester, and once after the course concluded. This was useful in guaging her perspective throughout regarding the degree in which she found using GitHub useful and effective for her needs, as well as to see what she struggled with. As well, lab instructors (one for each course) were interviewed towards the end of the course, to find out firstly how they utilized GitHub in their labs and secondly to discern their opinions on its effectiveness towards the learning activities they engaged the students in. Interviews with the instructors had a similar format to those with the students: semi-structured, 20-30 minutes long, with around 10 guiding questions.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
To Do

\section{GitHub Use}
The professor opted to use GitHub in the same way for both courses, using it in three pivotal ways: material dissemination, lab work, and project hosting. Advanced uses from instructors we spoke to in Chapter 4, such as utilizing Pull Requests and Assignment Submissions, were not used for these courses. The instructor was aware of some of these features; however, as a novice user of Git and GitHub, she didn't feel confident using it beyond her knowledge.

The main use case was material dissemination: the professor hosted a repository which all students could access to find the work they had to do for any given week. The instructor would update this repository weekly, adding in lab assignments, links to readings, and the student homework for the week. All of this would be organized into a calendar table made from Markdown, and visible right on the home page of the course repository as a readme.
%screenshot

The other main use was in the \'Issues\' page of the repositories, where all labs (2-3 hour long sessions once a week separate from the course lectures) were hosted. These labs would often involve either using a tool and reporting results or student project work and giving feedback in some form to each other. A dedicated issue would be posted for each lab, similar to a forum post, and students would then make comments on these issues based on their lab work.
%Lab assignments, however, were somewhat different between the two courses, where for Course #2 (Distributed Systems), labs tended to have more complex instructions

The last use was for project hosting. Although GitHub use was not mandatory, most projects were hosted on GitHub and individual repositories. These repositories would be public, so others in the course (and outside, in some courses), can view the work and give feedback. %listed on Coursespaces

\section{Participants}
The two courses used as cases were courses named Software Evolution (C1) and Distributed Systems (C2). We were able to conduct inteviews with x students from C1, and with y students from C2. The main distinction between the two courses were that C1 was an undergraduate-only Software Engineering (SENG) course whereas C2 was a Computer Science (CSC) course with a mix of undergraduate and graduate students. Otherwise, as outlined above, the courses were laid out in a similar manner. Table z summarizes the students who participated in interviews.

\section{Qualitative Findings}

The research findings are presented in accordance to the research questions of the study. From the analysis, several common patterns in themes in the responses of the participants as they came up. Beyond the themes, some interviewees gave unique feedback that were not mentioned by others, but were noteworthy for several reasons - for example, they might speak to the potential of the tool or are unique drawbacks that only few people experienced. These will be highlighted appropriately and reasons will be given for why they are noteworthy answers.

%table of themes?

\subsection{RQ1: How do students feel that the use of systems like GitHub can benefit their education?}
- Introduction to the tool and the way of working (for personal use)
To preface the first few themes, we must reiterate that GitHub as a tool is, in the current landscape of software development, one of the most popular tools for working, boasting 9 million users and xyz million projects. As such, it becomes almost essential for developers to be familiar with at least this way of working, particularly when working on collaborative, multi-person projects.

Students came into the course with varying degrees of experience with GitHub, as shown on table x. Some hadn't used it at all, while others were very knowledgeable about the tool either through their own uses, through group projects for other classes, or through co-op jobs. Many, at least those who have done the majority of their undergraduate studies in the University of Victoria, had some familiarity with Subversion, though not necessarily Git, as Subversion was taught in a second year course.

Many of the interviewees mentioned that the use of the tool in class provided a good introduction to the tool for the students: \textit{``Yeah I think it's pretty good. I mean one thing is that because I'm using it in class, it's made me learn the tool, and so now that I've used it outside of class, and that's where the big takeaway is that I've been able to transfer those skills, I've done some other projects just on my own time using GH.''} [P3] Others felt that in general, it was a good way of learning that way of working, which is beneficial for their careers: \textit{``I think [learning about the tool will] be very useful. Especially if I wanna work with any, open source, any newer companies, a lot of them have a lot of open source projects. Just knowing about version control and stuff like that is gonna be... really useful in the future.''} [P6]

In comparison to the use of more traditional LMS, one student noted why using GitHub might be advantageous for him: \textit{``Well I like how it's like the extra bonus of more practice of something you're gonna use in industry, whereas none of us are gonna use Coursespaces or Connex when we're out on a co-op or out on a job.''} [P4]

\textit{``I think when you go and work in software development too, you should get used to [having] lots of eyes being all over your work; that's just the way it's gonna be, so it's a practice before real life.''} [P13]

Those who had little experience with using Git and GitHub were given a good introduction to the features of the tool and how The GitHub Way works, particularly when they used it for their group projects. Others familiar with using Git and GitHub cited others in the class or in their groups that initially weren't familiar with it and acknowledged the way in which the class allowed them to experience this tool that many felt was important to know about as a software developer or as a computer scientist.

\textit{``Well I think the first thing is not quite everybody had used Git before. So for some people it was a bit of an introduction to it, but I think that's definitely a good thing. Better now than going on a coop, and the first day being like, \'here, here\'s the git repo'.''} [P4]

- Portfolio
As an extension to this, many believed that GitHub use in the course benefited them twofold. First, for those who were yet to be acquainted with GitHub, this introduction allowed them to see its features and benefits, with many of these students asserting that they intended to use GitHub more after the course is over. As well, for every student who would use GitHub to host and manage their projects in the course, many enjoyed the fact that their completed projects would be on their GitHub account publicly viewable for anyone to see. When asked about the motivations behind putting their work on GitHub, P8 explains: \textit{``to actually show to people and maybe have some people collaborating or maybe have employers see that I have worked on stuff... I have heard about some of my other friends, like their interviewers actually ask them to look into their repos and they actually download it and install the software and they would talk about it.''} [P8] Others describe the convenience factor: \textit{``I know that when you're trying to help somebody out, you can always just say \'Check out my GitHub\', I know I've done that with a few of my buddies... and I don't have to search through my files, it's just on GitHub, and you look on there. It's a good organization tool.''} [P10]

The reasoning many interviewees gave for this being a big benefit was that GitHub could serve as something akin to a portfolio for the students where their projects and their code hosted publicly could give them an advantage when job hunting. It has been acknowledged [cite] that many employers now look at GitHub accounts to help with hiring; in fact, some interviewees even had potential employers asking them to show their GitHub account: \textit{``...these days I see that employers also want to see your GitHub page. Like, while I was giving an interview for my coop, he did actually go into my GitHub profile and try to compile some of my code, so they do want you to have some online presence on GitHub. So it does help you in that, and since it's been used so widely, so, using it is necessary I think.''} [P5]

\textit{``It's always good for.. well I believe it's good for future employers. I remember I put directly on my resume saying you can check out the work I've done on GH. I included the link right on there and every person I handed my resume to were just like \'hey, fantastic!\'... it's a good way to get your skillset out there.''} [P10]

\textit{``I think all three of companies that I applied to this semester wanted me to link to my GitHub. So.. you know, I was really, I think, lucky that I had [a class] project on there. And I think when this project is done too, it'll also be really nice to have up there, after we clean it up and stuff.''} [P11]

As such, that students were able to a) be introduced to GitHub as a place to store their code and b) use GitHub as a portfolio of sorts where they can show off their projects to future potential employers was, for many a big benefit of using the tool in this manner. All of the interviewees asserted that they would use GitHub outside the class, whether or not they've had experience with it beforehand. \textit{``I've actually used it more now that since I've started using it in class actually.''} [P3] \textit{``Actually, I'm looking at using it on a personal project that's just like a game I'm working on, sort of.''} [P6]

- Student participation (changing material, tagging others in discussion, etc.)
In the previous chapter, one of the benefits that instructors claimed that their use of GitHub provided them over traditional learning management systems was the ability to allow their students to make changes, fixes, or suggestions to the course material. Traditionally, this could be done by speaking to the instructor either in-person or by email, and the instructor could then make the changes as necessary. With GitHub, however, the students are able to make Pull Requests, changing the material themselves and asking the instructor to \'accept\' or \'close\' (reject) their Pull Request as they deem appropriate.

However, in the case of these two courses, throughout the semester, only three Pull Requests were made to make fixes to the material. What's more, they were all made in the first month of the course and by only one student who was well-versed in GitHub and in both courses. His explains his reasoning:

\textit{``I like being able to fix the mistakes that she might make like with a bad link or something by making a PR... I really like being able to do that because you know, it makes me feel a little more involved.''} [P2]

However, early complications hindered this type of participation, as the early Pull Requests to fix the material or add links were not merged quickly enough. Another student describes the issues occurred \textit{``because we did not have the access. If we had the access, then I think people would have collaborated... I feel that either we should have had the access to merge it, or at least someone else would have had [access] who would have merged it quite quickly, like someone handling the PR. If we don't have the ability and someone is not merging it, then that just defeats the purpose.''} [P5] This is potentially an issue with how GitHub handles collaborators and who can accept Pull Requests.

Other students would acknowledge this is a nice benefit of using GitHub in this manner, claiming that it's something they could see themselves using had they known that it was an option. When asked about changes to make with the course and its workflow, P4 answers: \textit{``Like maybe if we can incorporate PRs in one way or another. Maybe with the idea I mentioned before, of having everyone contributing to the main repo... That would be neat and beneficial.''} [P4] \textit{``So it's good that other people, like students can also contribute to it... [it brings] more involvement from other people as well.''} [P8]

P11 offers the advantages of this system as opposed to the traditional way of suggesting material or fixing mistakes: \textit{``I think everybody's had experience with like mistakes in the course material... The alternative is just emailing the prof and asking them to change something... this is always there, and they can always check it to see if there's something. Oh and this way someone can actually make the change, all they'd have to do is accept it.''} [P11]

As such, some believed the professor should have given indication that this was an option. \textit{``I think [the idea is] good, but I think it would've needed to have been advertised more that she was looking for input on things, and if she said that, maybe more people would have [contributed] to maybe propose like extensions for assignments or something.''} [P12]

Discussions were another way that students felt was a good way of participating in the course. Although discussions are a part of multiple other tools, GitHub's discussions, via the Issues feature, provided an advantage that others didn't - Mentions. By typing someone's username preceded by the \'@\' symbol, the user gets \'mentioned\', and this has two implications: a) other users reading the comment know who the comment was addressed to and b) notify the user being mentioned that someone mentioned them in a comment.

In the Issues for the classes (which acted as the Labs), many students would use it simply to sign their work or acknowledge their group members as part of their answers. However, during labs where interactions were more encouraged, such as when they were set to comment on each others' work, students would use this Mentions feature, which would notify those mentioned that a comment was directed at them. Some found this useful: \textit{``I really like how once somebody's commented on the thread, you can just use the little @ symbol and send them a notification and vice versa. When someone mentions you in a comment, you'll see it on your email. Which is good.''} [P3]

- Openness
%group members held accountable
Another benefit provided by GitHub use came from its Transparency, and this served multiple purposes. The benefit cited most came from those who used GitHub to manage their group projects, where they could easily see if, and indeed when, their partners submitted work. Their repositories have an account of when each change was made, which gives collaborators an easy way to track the work being done on the project. This helped them keep up with each other's work, and is a commonly cited benefit of using systems like GitHub [cite Dabbish et al.]: \textit{``And just being able to kind of see what other people are doing on the repo you're working in, is kind of a motivation in a way too. It's like, oh hey they're working on this, I wanna do something cool like that too.''} [P4]

Indeed, this also helped them keep themselves and each other accountable, so they know exactly what work each member of their group put in: \textit{``we decided to switch to Pull Requests instead of just committing straight to master, because.. for a couple of reasons, first of all, if there's something like majorly wrong with it, like everyone can see it right? And the second thing is, everyone sees it, so if people have to work on [the same code], in the future, which we all did, then they know exactly what just went in, so that next time they come to the code and pull it, they're not like \'where did this all come from?\'''} [P14] This is a useful feature to have when working in group work as it allows for awareness between group members.

%able to see when repo is updated
Beyond that, having the course materials and schedule on the GitHub repository was helpful to some students thanks to the Transparency features of GitHub. If a change has been made or if the professor added something new to the repository, they would be informed in their News Feed and, if they are subscribed to the repository, by an email sent to them.

\textit{``I think once you star something, you get notified for every push to master, so you get all the changes to like, this home page readme, and anytime a new issue is posted.''} [P12]

Unfortunately, some experienced issues with this, particularly when they were subscribed to the repository. This will be covered later when their responses pertaining to Research Question 2 are highlighted. As well, only a few students cited this as a benefit, with some not even knowing that it was possible to get notifications by watching the repository and describing that as a weakness of the system.

%seeing other groups work
As well, the open and public nature of GitHub meant that students could easily see each others' projects, allowing them to get inspiration from others, keep tabs on their progress as pertaining to other groups, and give and receive feedback to each other. Though most only looked at other group's projects when mandated by a lab assignment, some interviewees found this aspect of group work helpful:

\textit{``It's nice seeing what everyone else is working on, because you're working on your own project, and you kind of get into your own little world, and then.. Yeah it's really interesting to see the other creative ideas that other people come up with... I actually think there was one person on [another] group, they had a really really interesting question, I kind of followed their repo as they went along, and finally got answer.''} [P10]

Two specific lab assignments had students looking at other people's repositories and giving comments on them, an exercise that students found useful, or at the very least, interesting. This is an exercise that is aided by the GitHub Way of working, in which the student projects are public, where the code is open to the other students in the course. Mainly, for students who spoke in detail about this benefit, they enjoyed receiving comments from the others:

\textit{``Yeah I liked getting the comments, I liked knowing that people were kind of checking it out, and I assume they would let me know if I was doing anything horribly wrong, and I didn't get any of those comments, I'm assuming that everything was going alright.''} [P10]

This would provide a opportunities for collaborations between groups, as demonstrated by a student's group working with others:
\texit{``For instance one [issue] was our script wasn't taking in command line arguments if there were spaces in them properly. And then someone was like, you can just put in quotes. And we were like \'oh, that\'s a lot better than what we were doing\'. And then to be able to see what other people are having problems with and give suggestions. Even at one point, they were trying to find refactorings, and we said hey you can use our tool, it'll help.''} [P4]

Some, however, found this exercise only potentially helpful:
\textit{``I think that it could be useful, I mean for my project, I definitely read through the other comments. But I already like a pretty good idea of what I thought I was gonna do, so I definitely took some of them into consideration, but I wouldn't say it was like super valuable for me, personally. But maybe if you like, if you actually were having big issues with your projects, and you don't know where to start, it might be useful.''} [P3]

While others took little time to go through other groups' repositories beyond what was required for the lab. When asked why, P11 responds: \textit{``Maybe [I'll look at the other repositories] at the end of the course. But like I know what ours looks like right now... It's a work in progress and I assume other people's are the same right now.''} [P11]

Regarding the lab assignments, in which every student would post something that was visible to the rest of the class as a response to the week's lab topic, many students discussed the benefits of having submitted work publicly available. Students found value in being able to see the work done by others for reasons such as comparing their work, learning from others, and even just curiosity.

\textit{``The one nice thing I like about just being able to do the issues like this as opposed to like a regular assignment submission is that you can see what the other people are doing. Which is really helpful if you're a certain standard of how much everyone else is typing, as well as if you're just out of ideas and you need somewhere to start with you're like, alright, that's an interesting idea, maybe I could look at that a little bit more.''} [P3]

\textit{``It's nice being able to see everyone else's answers, it's not just you writing an assignment and you handing it in and you don't really know what anybody else has done. And the questions have been constructed in a way [such as] \'find three tools\', so it's nice being able to review the tools other people have found, because you might not have found them either.''} [P10]

It should be noted that this style of lab assignment submission is easily replicated in traditional LMS through th euse of forums and discussion boards. %not sure I like this

%seeing public repos for inspiration or for using their libraries
Finally, the exposure to GitHub gave students opportunities to branch out away from the course and use repositories to aid them in their projects. When prompted, most interviewees mentioned that they sought out public repositories either to pull their code and use them or to find inspiration for their own projects. One student recounts an experience where their group looked at an open-source library: \textit{``we just looked at how Gitstats, [an open-source library] did it, and then wrote our own thing into our project... I think that more than anything is the biggest reason why Git should be used for education, because it takes I think until you start being forced to do it, or if you're like working on a job, to actually go and look at other people's code, and I think looking at other people's code is like the most important thing. I wish we did it sooner.''} [P11]

Speculatively, this likely would have happened regardless of whether or not GitHub was pushed by the professor as students tend to seek other code and libraries for their projects: \textit{``And in industry, the first thing you do is check Stack Overflow, look for someone else who has done the same thing and jack their code.''} [P12] However, this speaks to the openness of GitHub when students are able to pull in outside work to affect their own assignments and projects.

- Distributed version control, work from any computer
Though not necessarily related to how GitHub was used in their class, many students described advantages to using GitHub to host their school work, including their projects for this class. That is, students enjoyed being able to do their work from any computer:

\textit{``For me, the reason I started using it is because you know, I would start working on a project at home, and then realize 15 minutes into it that this was my saved version from a week ago, and I had done work since. Like \'oh it\'s on the school computer I need to go get it'. [And then] it finally clicked... I think it's really beneficial, by the time you get to 3rd year, for like networks, the big multi-week coding assignments that it\'d be really useful for.''} [P11]

Some students who were more experienced with using GitHub claimed they would use it for all their class work for this very reason. \textit{``And that's sort of where we're at, it's like I use it for everything. Even when there's no specific mandate for it, just the ability to pull it down in multiple places is worth having.''} [P7]

%version control, potential feedback. p7, group
As well, using version control for their assignments and projects benefited the students in multiple ways. P1, who worked alone on their project, recounts that using GitHub \textit{``makes it more traceable.. you can see when and where [your work has been done]''} [P1] This student utilized the history of their commits to remind themselves where to pick up from when they work on their project.

Importantly for some students, the system could allow instructors to give constructive feedback as they build their projects and assignments. One participant believed that the ability to see the student's process could be important: \textit{``You'd see all the mistakes they made getting there too, which is just as important to learning as the finished product.''} [P7] Another described the hypothetical situation, that professors could use student's repositories as submissions as opposed to the traditional way of submitting through LMS - sending the code only when finished. This student said that this way of submission would be \textit{``So much more useful... You could see everybody's contributions, you could comment on them too... Unless you're doing a live code demo with a TA or any instructor, you're not getting any real feedback [with the traditional submission system]... You have no idea where you lost the marks or where you went wrong.''} [P13]

- Potential for outsiders to participate in their work (unique)
There was one benefit that, although was mentioned by only one participant, was noteworthy to consider as highlighting the potential of using GitHub for these purposes. One student was highly active in the community of a certain programming language (Rust). For their project, they were building something highly related to the language and therefore he advertised his work to the community, who would go on to help his work in multiple ways:

\textit{``So here I have people involved in the discussion... these are just like people in the community I've been talking to about how to do different things, and they've been giving me suggestions. And that's really cool because I actually have like some community involvement in my course project.''} [P2] He notes how this is helpful for him: \textit{``But for me, I find it really validating when someone else is like \'that\'s really cool, have you considered doing this?' ''} [P2]

\subsection{RQ2: What are the challenges for students related to the use of GitHub in their classes?}
- Either completely public or completely private
While the public nature of GitHub provided advantages from some, others acknowledged the potential issues that such a way of working is sometimes not appropriate for a class environment. One person put it eloquently: \textit{``So [using GitHub for your work has] got benefits and drawbacks: benefits being that other people can access your data, drawbacks being that other people can access your data.''} [P6] This is relevant because the open way of working that GitHub tends to embrace can come at a cost, particularly in instances when work should be more private.

Most interviewees didn't mind that the class repository and their project work was completely public. Because of the issues being completely public would present, the course instructor decided that course work submission would be split into two different tools, GitHub and CourseSpaces. Students, however, tended to being displeased with this decision, as the split caused some confusion: \textit{``One thing I really don't like is that we have both systems set up, and so sometimes the announcements are in GitHub, and some of the times, they're in CourseSpaces, and that can get kind of confusing, like did she post an assignment here or here?''} [P3]

This was an almost uninamous issue between the students interviewed, with only a few stating that they did not mind either way. Most mentioned that they would have preferred it to be all on one tool, even if it was all public in GitHub. However, students acknowledged multiple problems with the work being public, and brought up potential issues had the whole course been done through GitHub. This is further discussed in RQ3.

%not everything is 100% effort
First, students mentioned that although they would ideally put 100\% effort into all their submissions, including lab assignments and comments, this is not always realistic due to the time crunch students face. P7, for example, noted that although it can be advantageous to put their code up in that employers are able to see their projects, it might backfire if the employer has a different mindset. \textit{``I think it comes back to what do you want to show your employers? When your employer looks at your work, will they understand that work I submitted in Git was when I didn't understand yet what I was doing, I was still learning? If there was the assumption, if I could make the assumption that an employer would understand that, I would have no problem with it being public. That said, I can't make that assumption. I have to assume that everything they look at they're judging in the harshest light possible. So I try to show only things that are of quality that I'm proud of. And that's unfortunately not a lot of the classwork until I'm done with it and the final product i'm happy to show, but all those steps getting there, they're often filled with pitfalls and horrible programming and badly factored code.''} [P7] As such, courses potentially mandating the use of Git and GitHub could be problematic for students.

Although one or two students felt that %quote if it's not your full effort, why hand it in?
, many who had an opinion acknowledged that sometimes, students rush through their work, and they therefore might not want work of that nature to be public. \textit{``You know it would actually be nice if they were separate or private somehow so I wouldn't have to go through everything and sanitize all the stuff I've submitted, because you know, for as much as you'd want to think you're putting 100\% into it, you're not really, you know, writing some great work of art or careful analysis, so... private would be nicer. For things like that.''} [P11]

%not everything is of interest to public
Beyond this, some felt that some of the work done on the course repository wouldn't even be of interest to the public or to potential employers, and as such they saw no need for the repository to be public. Regarding splitting up their comments between GitHub (where they're publicly viewable) or Coursepsaces (where only the class can see them), P2 asserted that \textit{``I'd rather have them be private. But only because there's not a whole lot of participation, so I don't feel they're of interest to someone publicly.''} [P2]

\textit{``It's good for finished projects, but not all that in-between stuff. I don't wanna show these issue things that I've submitted, to employers because they'd have to wade through that. They don't wanna see that, they wanna see finished projects and what that looks like after you're done.''} [P11]

Yet, others saw no issue, and even preferred all their work to be in the public space. \textit{``Personally I don't have a problem with it being public. I would like to have a good online activity of myself on GitHub, so that's not really an issue. Like I'm not really concerned if someone is going to read my blog or not. So that's not really an issue like I'm not really concerned if someone is going to read my blog or not. So it wasn't a concern for me, I don't know why Yvonne was so concerned about it. ''} [P5]

%first group's submissions rule all
A benefit cited earlier was the openness of the tool, where students are able to see each other's work and submissions to the lab assignments. However, many acknowledged that this way of working where everybody in the class can see submissions simply could not work in other types of courses, particularly those in which assignments have only one solution. \textit{``In this particular course, because each person's project is so different and unique, there's really no way you could do plagiarism, it just doesn't make sense. But if for some courses where everybody is giving the same exact assignment, and you're all on GH, I think I'd be a little more nervous about putting my code up. ''} [P3] This is further discussed in RQ3.

In fact, some saw this effect even on the lab submissions in this course, even though lab work typically varies from group to group. \textit{``I'm not sure if it's good or not that we can see other people's submissions as we go along in the lab. Because I think, because of that, all of the submissions have ended up looking like the first submission.''} [P11] However, as mentioned by many students, this is potentially a benefit, by giving them examples to follow or a standard to measure up to.

There are workarounds to some of these privacy issues, where students do not have to attach their names to the work they put into the GitHub repositories involved in the class. \textit{``I think part of that would be.. you can decide that on your own, depending on if you use like your main git account or just make like a separate git account for your class and whatnot. ''} [P4] Indeed, one student did create a new GitHub user just for contributions to the class. Unfortunately, this student did not want to be interviewed, and group members were uncertain as to what the motivation behind creating a new user was; presumably, they were motivated by some of the issues posted above.

- Not enough education on Git/GH
Another issue that many students described with using GitHub in the class is education - there were wildly varying degrees of experience with and knowledge of GitHub and it's features, which presented difficulties with its use. For example, some asserted that many of the benefits, such as the ability to make Pull Requests on the class material, were unknown to those less experienced with the tool, and as such was not taken advantage of. If the professor did not set a precedent for that behavior, it would not be used. \textit{``I think you just have to, 1. advertise it so that the students know [to] use this as a communication tool. And then 2., kind of layout, or give some examples on how it could be used, I guess.''} [P14]

This lends itself to a bigger picture - educating the students on Git, GitHub, and the GitHub way, as well as the instructors' intended workflow for using the tool in the course. As the course instructor for these two cases was quite novice at using GitHub, this made it difficult to know how to educate the students and caused some frustration for some of the interviewees. \textit{``I wish [the instructor] knew how to use GH, that would be nice. Because yeah I was submitting pull requests to actually make her readmes that were .markdowns markdown files instead of html files, and stuff like that. ''} [P2]

Most students who were asked mentioned that the course could have benefited from more education on Git, GitHub and what they can do with it. Many said that they could have hosted a lecture or a lab dedicated to educating them about the tool, perhaps at the beginning of the course or as an extra. \textit{``I think it would've been good to do some demo... cause I think [the instructor] talked too much about theory in class and there's no actual coding or no actual demoing.''} [P1]

Those experienced with GitHub still acknowledged the usefulness of hosting such a session: \textit{``there's people who have never used it, like [a group member] in our group has never used it so she's just getting used to all the features... if we wanted to maybe tie it all together, it probably would've been useful to have a little Git session for the people who didn't know how to use Git''} [P11]

%\textit{``Even just like on the first day of the lab just going through some of this stuff. I think what we did on the first day was that if you didn't have a GH account, you were supposed to go and create one. That part's really straightforward, commenting on issues is really straightforward, that's no problem. The only problem is when you actually start working with code and working with versioning...''} [P3]

One student acknowledged the potential difficulties in hosting such a session: \textit{``On the other hand, when someone teaches it to you, it often doesn't make sense until you actually do it yourself. Cause you'd actually have to go through the struggles of actually doing a commit and like pressing all the buttons, so I don't really know how much could be done in that regard.''} [P3]

Interestingly, students also asserted that there should be a bigger emphasis on version control systems such as GitHub in the undergraduate level at University of Victoria. As it stands, there is one required course that students said touches on distributed version control systems and how to use them, heavily utilizing Subversion and touching on Git. Some, however, did not feel that it was enough, particularly when SVN is much less popular. \textit{``I think in [SENG265], we did SVN, which is a good introduction to the idea. But I don't think it's widely used anymore. ''} [P4]

\textit{``, I could tell you I think it was SENG 265. And it was, we were kind of introduced, we were told what version control was, and \'oh yeah you could use SVN or you could use Git, or both\'. We were kind of introduced to it, we were never required, or even really pushed to use it''} [P10]

Some would lament the theoretical focus they believed the undergraduate software engineering or computer science departments had: \textit{``I think that's one of the biggest problems, even SENG being taught in a university that focuses a lot on theory, and not a lot on technical.. like one of our only classes where we got to actually learn technical skills, and it's a really technical area.''} [P13]

Some believe that students should be getting an account pretty quickly after their first introduction courses to Computer Science. \textit{``if I was teaching someone how to code, as soon as they start working on code that was bigger than 100 lines, I would teach them how to use version control.''} [P2]

\textit{``the first class where you have a big project, like a group project where you're sharing code, it should be taught''} [P11]

They believed that students should be putting their code into GitHub early on as it is potentially beneficial for them for them. \textit{``I think it would have been great to have, especially in first year, if you did open one and use it throughout your education, it really does provide a place where all of your stuff is stored. You'll be glad that you can go back to all your old work. It doesn't always fit in exactly what you're looking for, but you'll remember oh I did this somewhere, where is it?''} [P7]

It is important, however, to communicate the benefits of using such a system. \textit{``The first challenge is to get them really interested, because many of them are exposed to many other tools already. So I think to really bring up the... advantages [that] GH can bring to the students so they can use GH as a primary tool and convince them that it's really good''} [P9]

- Notifications
Although only one student brought up this issue, it remains a drawback because of how GitHub handles notifications from the repository. As it stands, the only way to get notifications from a course repository is to \'Watch\' the repository. \'Watching\' provides two different options: to get a notification (and an email) only when the user is mentioned in issues or commits and in discussions the user has commented on, or to get a notification (and an email) when anything at all happens in the main branch (master), someone makes a comment on issues, commits, or Pull Requests, and when someone makes or accepts a Pull Request. The benefits of this system were outlined earlier, but unfortunately, this also presented problems to some students.

\textit{``I didn't like that at all, because I didn't get notified when she adds stuff to there, so I don't really know what's going on without remembering to check it on GH. ''} [P14] This student did hear about the \'Watch\' solution, but thought that it \textit{``would be a good solution, but it might be overkill. For like a spelling change.''} [P14]

The crux of the issue is that unless students are \'Watching\' the repository, they would not receive email notifications for anything. However, if they do \'Watch\' the repository, they would receive an influx of notifications for every user comment on the discussions, which for some, is too noisy.

%- Integration with UVic
%Another point that students felt would hinder GitHub as a learning tool was the lack of integration with the University of Victoria login, similar to that which LMS such as CourseSpaces have. This means that students will have to create new accounts to an external site (if they didn't have one already) and, more importantly, that the administrative tasks that LMS usually take care of such as grades and class participant lists cannot be done on a tool like GitHub.

%Hmm.. The one thing about CS is that it's all integrated with the current school system. So in terms of like adding your grades and feedback that way, I don't think profs are even allowed to upload grades into GH, there'd be some big issues there. *laughs*. So.. that'd be one thing. [P3]

%Uh, it's fine, but we like to, we like to get a more into interactive with the CS. For example, if somebody post something on GH, we couldn't know anything that is not on CS, because these two are not connected. [P9]

%Right now I have to say GH is... to me, I value them equivalently, just because the university enforce CS into their system. So I'm pretty sure in the future if the university can include GitHub into their university system, I think students are more prefer GH. [P9]

%Uh, the only thing I can think of is maybe somehow.. I don't even know how it would work, but if they could somehow be.. connected with UVic. Like, I'm not even sure how that would work, but.. some sort of academic affiliation or something. [P10]


\subsection{RQ3: What do students feel is the ideal workflow for using GitHub in the classroom?}

Given that the use of GitHub in these two cases were relatively basic, many students, particularly those who are experienced with using GitHub for collaboration purposes, had ideas on how GitHub could be further utilized to be more beneficial for both themselves and for their professors. Many students brought up topics such as which classes GitHub could best serve, x, and the need to utilize more features of GitHub than their course did. This section discusses those responses, highlighting what students feel would be an ideal situation for a professor to use GitHub in this manner.

- Type of Course
As discussed earlier, students had things to say regarding the nature of the work put on GitHub. While most students interviewed did not mind their work and their discussions being in the public space and even saw the benefits of them, there were concerns regarding how this way of working could apply to different types of courses, where students are afforded less freedom in the nature of their work. As well, some did not even see sense in keeping a course repository open for the public because of issues highlighted earlier, such as that it just won't be interesting for outsiders and that their work might often be rushed and therefore unappealing to have on display.

As such, some students, such as P2, P10, and P11, would suggest that for the workflow done on this course, where the discussions are self-contained, the course repository did not need to be public. This would avoid some of those issues discussed for students, but would similarly conflict with some of the benefits extracted from our instructor interviews in the last chapter. A suggestion for avoiding these issues came from one interviewee: \textit{``I think that as long as we have the option to make [our discussion comments] private, maybe after the course ends. So keep it intact while the course is ongoing and then we have the option [to change the privacy], everything will be okay.''} [P18] Currently, GitHub does not support doing such tasks, unless the course instructor decides to privatize the course repository as a whole after a course ends or an individual student deletes their comments and posts. %While this is a potential solution, these tools like GitHub would need work to meet such a solution. %this might be DSCS-worthy

Regarding what type of course would best suit using GitHub, students that had an opinion mentioned that a course similar to these two cases, where the work is very much open-ended and could be in a public space, is where using a tool like GitHub would most benefit the students. When asked about his experiences with seeing others' projects in this course versus in other courses, P12 said: \texit{``I would say this class is specifically different because we had so much flexibility over what we were doing, it's not like in our OS class, it's like go make this shell that does this, this, and this. Where this was way more open ended, everyone's doing something different, so even if you could see what everyone else is doing, no one could've helped us.''} [P12]

Students would acknowledge that the open-ended nature of this course was what allowed the use of GitHub to be successful, but it might be less successful in less open-ended courses. Regarding the potential use of GitHub in their future courses, P10 discussed their thoughts: \textit{``Like I said, I like seeing other people's work and whatnot... Maybe not if everyone has the same assignment, because everyone's just gonna cheat off each other.''} [P10]

\textit{``It works really well for this too, because it's not the same thing that everybody's submitting. So even if the format's the same, the content's gonna be different. So obviously if it was something where there was an answer, it'd be awful for it.''} [P11]

\texit{``With something like Operating Systems class, where everyone's building a shell, and it's all in C, you all have the same system calls and it's more like a puzzle where you gotta put it together the right way, you can just look at someone else's and be like \'oh that\'s how that's done\', right?... If they have everyone's code up available to everybody, then that's kind of pointless? ''} [P12]

As discussed above, with no formal assignment submission feature, GitHub would struggle when students were uploading their assignments if all the assignments had a specific answer. P11 brainstormed a potential workaround: \textit{``I was thinking you could even do that with like pull requests, you just start a PR, each person just a PR, and the teacher just accepts all of them on the due date, or whatever.''} [P11] However, this is indeed a workaround and may require more effort from the parts of both the instructor and the student.

- Mandate the use of Collaborative Features
The more GitHub-experienced students mentioned that the more collaborative features of GitHub should have been further utilized so as to take advantage of the uniqueness of using GitHub over traditional LMSes. One issue that some students discussed was that they saw no point in using GitHub for classes if it was in the way their course did it. Many of the potential benefits were not realized because the tool was used in a basic level. As mentioned in RQ1 above, for example, only 3 Pull Requests were made throughout the semester for a variety of reasons.

P7 was very outspoken on why using GitHub for this course was somewhat unnecessary. \textit{``I don't see any benefit that GH has offered that we wouldn't have had in CS. All it appears to me is it's a place where she's.. it's a file repo for what it's being used, and we already have that. So I'm trying to see where the additional benefit, other than it being semi-confusing as to when I'm trying to look for a lab or an assignment and I now have two places to check instead of one.''} [P7] In elaborating, they note that there's potential there, but the unidirectional nature of the work being done meant that there was little benefits provided. \textit{``If there was a way to collaborate on the material, that would be useful... But in this class, every one of our labs so far has been demo to the lab TA, so nothing's going back to GitHub... Maybe if we were submitting things to it, maybe that would be helpful. I can see how it could be useful, it's just that in our usage it's not really adding anything to the experience.''} [P7] It should be noted that this student's project group did not use GitHub to collaborate, using Docker [footnote] instead. That said, they were very critical of why GitHub was used as the course repository.

P12 echoes these sentiments: \textit{``I think that... you can accomplish the same thing with a simple HTML website, honestly... It's not using a lot of the features of Git, like looking at changes, commits, Pull Requests. The issues were kinda cool for the lab, and, again, you can accomplish that with any sort of forum, I would think... We're not actually delivering code to the professor, so maybe it doesn't make a ton of sense [to be using GitHub].''} [P12]

As such, these students, as well as a few others, believed that GitHub was not being used to it's full potential in their course by not utilizing its full feature set. This means that some of the benefits they described to using such a system and to using that way of working in a classroom were only possibilities. An example of it, which will be highlighted later, was in the Distributed Systems course, where even the issues were not used during labs for discussion. \textit{``So basically we had to show it to our TA that we have done [the lab], and he used to mark it in a piece of paper. So putting it here [in the issues] was not really necessary right?''} [P5] An important lesson to learn from this is that GitHub only equips instructors and students with the possibility to take advantage of the benefits it offers. %This theme ties closely with the next one.

- Define a workflow
Students acknowledged that GitHub was not being used to its full potential and that there was a lot of confusion surrounding the use of two tools (GitHub and Coursespaces) to cover up the drawbacks of GitHub. Combined, many students suggested that it would have been important to define a workflow for using this tool in a course in order to use it to reap the benefits described earlier in the chapter. This includes activities mentioned before such as utilizing Pull Requests or using just one tool. In the case of Pull Requests, for example, students advocated that the instructor should be advertising their use, thereby defining that contributing to the material would be part of the course workflow.

One student would assert that although GitHub doesn't do everything needed in a course, defining a workflow will cover up many of those weaknesses. \textit{``Even if there are no enhancements on GH, but if you define a proper workflow of using it, then it can be quite successful, because even the present Learning Management Systems are not perfect right?''} [P5]

While most students didn't have suggestions as to what workflow to use, they still acknowledged the importance of defining it and teaching it to the students early on in the course. P11 wanted to \textit{``enforce more actual Git and GitHub features in the way that we interact with the course material, and enforced GitHub use for actual projects. In a way that everybody had sort of a base level of understanding. So maybe at the beginning of the course... there should definitely be a time when you learn Git.''} [P11]

Beyond the workflow for the course as a whole, some also had difficulties getting on the same page as their group because there was no defined workflow. \textit{``I initially wanted to post all the issues and our conversation so we could account for who's doing what. But they basically didn't respond to them at all, so I moved to email. They responded to that a couple of days later so that was nice.''} [P2] As such, students believed that having a properly defined workflow would go a long way towards reaping some of the benefits and bypassing some of the limitations behind using GitHub as a learning tool.

%Uh, I would create students directories, one for each student for the course, they have their own directories. Later on, if there's group work or group projects, I would at least like students to form a group and create their own project directories in there. And they can view their stuff as well as outsiders can also view what's going on the course. [specific workflow]

%Yeah, I would like to see Yvonne maybe using the Wiki a bit more. Because the readme's good, but it's very long. So and the readme, I think should be more of a directory, like go here for this, go here for this, and key updates, like don't forget the midterm on Thursday. But the wiki you can actually construct it like a book. So that would be nice if that was set up. [workflow]

%I think more teaching on maybe more common industry practices when you go about it. Cause there's so many ways you can use GH, and I was actually looking at some other people in our class' GH pages, and the way they did it was quite different from the way we did it. Like we did the whole PR workflow, which, I don't think I'm biased but I think that's like a really good workflow. And then you see like other people aren't even using issues so.. I think maybe just a little more teaching on the capabilities of GH.


\subsection{RQ4: How do students feel the GitHub approach and GitHub as a tool in comparison to more traditional Learning Management Systems?}
One of the goals of this research study was to see how GitHub would fare as a tool that served similar functions to learning management systems (LMS), particularly from the student perspective. Instructors that we spoke to in Chapter 4 described using GitHub in such a manner, which made this use case worthy of investigation. The instructor for these case studies believed in the benefits of this way of working as well. As highlighted in Chapter 2, the primary purposes of traditional LMS include material dissemination, announcements, assignment submission, and discussion among the students and instructors.

- Discussions
The feature that came up the most in interviews when GitHub was being compared to traditional LMS at UVic (Connex/Sakai, Coursespaces/Moodle) were discussions and forums. For both courses, the students had two main places where they could discuss and comment - on the course repository's \'Issues\' area and on Coursespaces' Forums. The professor separated these, by assigning all lab work and discussion to GitHub and the assignment readings and comments to Coursespaces.

Students were generally receptive to the use of issues as posts, particularly as it offered some flexibility otherwise not seen on regular forums. For one, students liked the ability to \'Mention\' others and be notified when they themselves are \'Mentioned\', as there is a convenience to receiving this notification. \textit{``I really like how once somebody's commented on the thread, you can just use the little @ symbol and send them a notification and vice versa. When someone mentions you in a comment, you'll see it on your email. Which is good.''} [P3] This is a feature generally not available in the learning management systems used in the University of Victoria.

However, the GitHub Issues way of discussion did not resonate with all students. The main difference between this type of discussion and those seen in forums in traditional LMS is the lack of \'tree-style\' discussion in GitHub, where all comments on an issue are linearly arranged by time. Meanwhile, in the Coursespaces forums, for example, there are top-level comments in a thread which users can reply to, and those would be arranged in a manner which makes conversation easy to follow. \textit{``GitHub unfortunately doesn't have any sort of like tree style view of conversation, it's just linear, so it's really hard to actually have a conversation between multiple people... As opposed to Coursespaces, which is kind of more tree-styled.''} [P2] The main issue with this, according to this student, is following these conversations: \textit{``And you literally have to go and search for all of the conversations from foo and bar and try to piece them together. It would be nice if it had like a reply that would put it right underneath.''} [P2]

Students who offered up suggestions for possible improvements to GitHub often discussed changes to this style of commenting, advocating a style similar to that of Coursespaces. \textit{``If there was a way to actually directly reply and keep track of what's going on, it would also be a lot easier to look at your post and see if anyone's replied to it, as opposed to reading every single post and seeing \'oh that mentioned me!\'''} [P4] There were similar sentiments by P5 and P7.

One student did, however, think there was usefulness in the linear style of GitHub comments as opposed to the tree-style of Coursespaces. When asked if they read through the posts on Coursespaces, P12 responded that they didn't as much as they did the GitHub comments, because \textit{``the way it works is, she's posted the questions and then there's responses, but to see responses you click right into it. If it was more GitHub format, then you'd have to scroll through all the responses before getting down to the bottom to write your own.''} [P12] It should be noted, however, that these are two different types of comments on each tool, and that the comments on GitHub were posted more in real-time, so this could have contributed to this disconnect.

Moreover, Issues offer some flexibility in that when student projects are hosted on GitHub, students are able to help each other out in each others repositories by filing issues in the project repositories themselves, which is another point of convenience as it consolidates it into the project repository. Of our interviewees, this behavior was seen in only one project, P16 and P2's project, where P4 could not build their code properly and helped them through the process.

- GitHub is not built for Education
A few students described one drawback behind using GitHub for education - it's simply not built for it. Those that mentioned this particular drawback acknowledged that there's workarounds for many of the tasks needed, but that GitHub certainly struggles to meet some educational needs such as Gradebooks and proper Assignment Submission. In traditional LMS, for example, assignment submission tends to be a private upload of relevant files visible only to the instructor. This simplifies the process, ensuring that there is only one submission when the assignment is new.

These courses did not utilize GitHub for any form of submission of their code. However, when asked regarding GitHub serving as an LMS, many students highlighted this lack of formal submission features in GitHub. As highlighted earlier, for example, P11 stated that \textit{``If there was gonna be assignment submissions, you'd have to figure out a way to do that properly.''} [P11], and suggested potential workarounds by using Pull Requests. When listing off features that would hinder GitHub from being a learning tool, others, such as P7, P8, and P12, also highlighted the lack of formal submission as a potential hindrance.

The potential benefits of using GitHub were also hindered because it is not a tool geared for educational tools. As discussed in the last chapter, for example, GitHub does not handle file types common to class material well, such as PDFs and PPTs. This makes it difficult to make changes to course material that involve these file formats. \textit{``I think one disadvantage of.. or one drawback of GH is that you cannot actually see the diff [of] commonly used files such as PPTs or PDFs, so you can't really use it for correcting professor's slides, or PDFs.''} [P18]

Students would also bring up the inability to do tasks common in most LMSes. For example, for the University of Victoria and many other universities, including a gradebook is impossible to do without a tool where data is controlled by the university. \textit{``Because at least with Coursespaces, you can access your grades and access your schedule that's coming up, and you can access your entire transcript. But that needs to stay in the school domain, not in the public GitHub.''} [P10] As such, there's difficulty managing the more administrative tasks because of GitHub being public and because of data being stored on GitHub's servers rather than the university's.

Overall, students would acknowledge that GitHub was, at the moment, not geared towards education, which makes it difficult to do some tasks, making it necessary to find potentially clunky workarounds. \textit{``But I believe that mainly as GitHub is for projects hosting, it's not specifically for learning, like Coursespaces or some other dedicated tools... For example, if we want to initiate some discussions, there's a workaround way to use issues, but I think issues are [typically] for projects and stuff. [P8]''} [P8]

P14 acknowledges this: \textit{``Right now it definitely feels like we're using a tool that's geared for something else and trying to throw education on top of it... So if you could integrate them better into another tool or maybe a plugin for GitHub if they ever did something like that.''} [P14] Unfortunately, the two potential solutions they described is not a realistic option for now. When asked exactly what GitHub would need to provide to make it more suitable for education, they noted some features typically found in LMS: \textit{``Like deliverables... Like grades... Announcements that you'd actually get by email, not just code, commit changes.''} [P14]

- Simplicity of interface
Many of the students discussed how much they preferred the GitHub interface over the Coursespaces interface. While for some, it was due to popularity, others simply enjoyed the way in which the readme was laid out. Some students, such as P13 and P18, complained that the User Interface of the learning management systems used in UVic often did not meet their expectations. \textit{``I think Connex and Coursespaces were made specifically for...course management. So I think they're more capable [for that]; just functionality wise, the capability's there, but maybe the UI-wise, is not as friendly.''} [P18]

P1, P8, P9, and P18 described the GitHub UI as cleaner or friendlier, particularly in the way the course schedule has been laid out in the front page readme. Some, like P2 and P19, would assert that they were more comfortable with the GitHub interface because of their familiarity with the tool, as opposed to a tool like Coursespaces. \textit{``Also, because it's how big GitHub is and how familiar I am with it, I can navigate it a lot easier than say, Coursespaces.''} [P19]

%- Offers more opportunities for engagement - not really a theme.
%Some students described GitHub as having offered more opportunities for participation and for engagement than traditional LMS, and could therefore see it as beneficial in that manner.

\section{Instructors' Perspectives}
To Do

\section{Discussion}
The motivation behind this study was to uncover student perceptions on using GitHub as an educational tool by asking them to describe their thoughts and experiences as they experience them. In these two courses, the use of GitHub was at a fairly basic level, as the professor utilized it to disseminate material and update the class schedule and to have students submitting and discussing various topics during lab sessions, while most of the students interviewed opted to use the tool for their course projects, either collaboratively or alone.

\subsection{A Student-Oriented Learning Tool}
GitHub has features that provide some of the more prominent features found in more traditional LMS, particularly those surrounding information dissemination and discussion. From Malikowski et al.\'s [cite] model, the main actions are easily done when GitHub is used in an educational setting. As to be discussed in the next chapter, some workarounds must be utilized to cover some of the finer-grain features of traditional LMS, such as assignment submission.

Where GitHub has the potential to excel, however, is in addressing some of the concerns regarding traditional LMS outlined by various authors. Mott [cite 2010] discusses the \'walled garden\' approach of LMSes, where the content is limited only to those officially enrolled in the course, and that they support administrative functions better than actual teaching and learning activities. García-Peñalvo [cite 2011] echoes these concerns, asserting that students need to be placed at the centre of the e-learning process. This could be addressed by allowing students opportunities to participate and connect with and learn from each other, beyond basic material dissemination - the main utility of LMS [cite McLoughlin].

\subsubsection{Material Dissemination & Interaction}
GitHub can offer new ways to participate in the course and in the course material as well as opportunities to open up learning for the outside, thereby placing a greater emphasis on student agency in their learning. These new activities are supported by GitHub's collaborative features such as Pull Requests, Mentions, and the openness and transparency. Moreover, for students in fields as technical as Computer Science and Software Engineering, the use of a DCVS tool to support classroom activities provides an invaluable experience in a way of working that many groups in the field utilize. At the very least, the mere exposure of the system to students, even for trivial tasks like material dissemination, lets them learn about the tool and its features. This is reflected by many of the students' responses, from those who had very little prior experience to GitHub to those that believed that students should be given exposure to the tool in earlier courses.

In examining the Contributing Student Pedagogy put forward by Hamer et al. [cite 2008], GitHub provides many of the characteristics of the pedagogy, where, for example, students are switching roles from passive to active and the focus on student contribution. %CSP tools 2011

This is evidenced by student responses to the interviews, where students would claim more enjoyment or engagement thanks to the ability to see other groups' work or make changes or fixes to the course material. However, it is important to note that like any technology, meeting these characteristics requires the stakeholders to \'buy-in\' and use the relevant features of the tool to support this pedagogy. It's possible that there were different levels of enthusiasm for the tool between the two courses because of the difference between how it was utilized in labs, where the first case (SE) would require students to post, leading to looking at others' responses, while the other case (DS) would not, requiring only a demo to the lab instructor instead.

\subsubsection{Open Participation}
While traditional LMS can replicate the open discussion style that GitHub necessarily has, there are features in GitHub that lend itself well to student participation. In terms of the workflow in these courses where lab assignments involved open discussions as \'Issues\', users can \'Mention\' specific people to alert them, a feature not often seen in traditional discussion boards and forums. This has a few implications: it's a way to easily reach specific people publicly to comment on their work, it's a way for students to give credit to others, and it's an easy way to publicly communicate between student and professor. This lends itself well the participatory culture [cite Jenkins], where student contributions take an important part of the work. GitHub can therefore serve as a good tool for letting students be a part of each others' education in a social constructivist manner [cite Kim 2001].

Significantly, while LMS may be too focused on the administrative side of education [cite Mott, Garcia-Penalvo, etc.], GitHub on its own may not offer enough administrative functions to be useful. This is what initially led the course instructor to use two different tools for these courses to begin with, and the students seemed to agree that the lack of features such as a Gradebook, Assignment Submission, and Announcements could hinder the use of GitHub as a learning tool. This means that future uses of GitHub may always be relegated to being a second tool, rather than fitting all the needs of a course. Of course, as a tool geared towards development rather than education, GitHub need not serve these purposes. However, this means that future tools that might address these benefits and these drawbacks of GitHub would need to ensure that the administrative functions are not ignored.

Future tools would also need to address the privacy issues highlighted by many of the students. While to an extent, having the work publicized is a good thing, some students had reservations regarding activities like discussions, questioning why certain activities had to be public. %TO DO

\subsubsection{Project Work}
The third piece of the puzzle in these cases was the use of GitHub for group and individual projects. It should be stressed that using GitHub in this manner requires a certain type of course, one in which assignments and projects are more open-ended with no set answer. Otherwise, it becomes problematic to prevent students from getting each other's answers and copying from each other.

The most important benefit GitHub provides to the students interviewed was the experience in working in such a manner. While material dissemination using GitHub could provide a good introduction to the tool amongst other benefits, many of the development-minded students gained good experience by using GitHub to develop their projects, learning about that way of working that is so prevalent in the industry. Beyond the experience, students would also gain a portfolio that can be easily shown off to prospective employers.

Beyond that, GitHub provides a space that extends beyond the reach of the classroom. A student can utilize it so that outsiders can contribute to their work, which for some can be very rewarding. From the instructor's perspective, it's trivial to see exactly what work the student did and what was brought in from the outside, giving this potential use few downsides. It goes the other way as well, where students can easily reuse work from the outside as a part of their code or as inspiration to their code. This lends itself very well to the more open learning platforms discussed in the background section. %I will cite some stuff here..

Finally, although it wasn't part of the workflow for these cases, students were excited about the potential of using version control as potentially a submission platform. This could have implications for better feedback from instructors, for convenience of being able to help out remotely, and for instructors to track student work.
