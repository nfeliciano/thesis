%GITHUB WAY GITHUB WAY GITHUB WAY

As technology continues to play a vital role in the education of post-secondary students, web-based tools have evolved in ways that cater to educational needs. Instructors in classrooms both local and remote utilize a number of these technologies to disseminate material and engage their students, whether they are tools such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), which are focused on education, or tools created for other purposes such as social media platforms, but used in an educational context. These tools can be defined as tools for `e-learning', a term that can be defined as \textit{``electronically mediated asynchronous and synchronous communication for the purpose of constructing and confirming knowledge''} \cite{garrison2011learning}.

Coinciding with the Web 2.0 movement \cite{O'Reilly-What-2005} in web technology, education began to emphasize social interaction through the use of social media or computer-mediated communication tools. Such tools have characteristics which afford users more freedom to create, publish, and co-create content. This allows for an approach to learning characterized by a \emph{demand-pull} model rather than a \emph{supply-push} model, which focuses on participation and providing students access to rich learning communities \cite{seely2008open}. These tools have introduced ways for students to be more than passive observers who absorb content as given to them; instead, they are able to participate in the communities and collaborate with others in their learning. As a result, learning can become more social and more engaging. Computer Science and Software Engineering education utilize these e-learning tools in similar ways to other disciplines.

%However, tools and technologies play an important role in computing careers, particularly in software development where collaborative processes and work rely on the use of various technologies. Therefore, it is vital in this discipline that e-learning tools evolve to accommodate the students' learning needs, training and familiarizing them with these collaborative processes so prevalent in the field.

In the software development field, GitHub serves as a social code sharing service which utilizes the Git distributed version control system. For many groups and projects, it is an essential tool for areas that require collaboration, and has even seen utilization in areas outside software development such as technical writing. The advantages of GitHub and similar tools include its awareness and transparency features, where collaborators are better made aware of others' work \cite{dabbish2012social}. As well, collaborators in a GitHub repository can be involved in a project in a number of ways, such as contributing to discussions regarding bugs and features in the Issues pane or making changes to a project itself and allowing other collaborators to review and accept their changes via a pull request. This way of working is called `The GitHub Way' \footnote{\url{http://www.wired.com/2013/09/github-for-anything/}} - the way groups and collaborators work on GitHub - as these features are not necessarily exclusive to GitHub and could be found in other Distributed Version Control Systems (DCVS) such as BitBucket. I expand on this in Chapter 3.

This thesis explores tools in computer science and software engineering education, specifically identifying GitHub's use in this context as a way to fill the gaps that exist in current e-learning tools. For both educators and students, working using The GitHub Way has both potential benefits and drawbacks, which this work aims to explore and identify. As well, this work seeks to determine whether or not `The GitHub Way' is a viable approach in computer science and software engineering education.

\section{Problem Statement}
An important goal of computer science and software engineering education is to prepare students for their future careers in industry. As many software projects today are increasingly collaborative, such as those in globally distributed or open-source projects, it becomes necessary for educators to prepare their students for a career in this environment. Yet, in discussing group and collaboration skills, many researchers and educators assert that students are generally lacking in their group work skills \cite{waite2004student}.

While some are making adjustments to their curricula to account for this gap \cite{jazayeri2004education} and giving students opportunities to develop skills in environments closer to real-world experiences \cite{coleman2012collaboration}, another area to investigate is the use of tools in computer science and software engineering education. Extending to other disciplines, web-based e-learning tools are regularly used in education as the main portal for students to engage with a course and its participants. Therefore these tools, which are traditionally Learning Management Systems (LMS), becomes an important point of interaction between not just the students and educators, but between the students themselves. Yet many of these tools are poorly equipped to handle collaborative tasks and student participation because of their focus on administrative and instructor tasks rather than on student learning \cite{mcloughlin2007social}. As such, a gap exists in traditional learning tools, where their collaborative and participatory features can be addressed. This is particularly important in areas such as computer science and software engineering education where participation and collaboration is an important part of the career landscape for students.

%This thesis includes two studies which address this gap, where I examine the use of GitHub as an educational tool that can provide benefits for instructors such as the ability to remix course content and various ways to engage their students, and benefits for students such as the ability to more actively participate in a course and to learn a way of working prevalent in the field.

This thesis includes two studies which address this gap, where I examine the use of GitHub as an educational tool that can provide benefits for instructors and students. However, with these benefits come drawbacks and challenges with using a tool not meant for education and these are also explored in these two studies. Conclusions from these studies can help shape the development of future educationally-focused tools that may choose to emphasize the `GitHub Way'.

\section{Motivation}
% GitHub for education Greg Wilson
The idea of GitHub use in educational contexts is certainly not novel. In 2007, a few years after GitHub's release, a well-known computer science educator, Greg Wilson, suggested that GitHub could be used for learning materials despite its limitations, citing remixing as the big benefit of using GitHub in this context\footnote{\url{http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2011/12/fork-merge-and-share.html}}.

\begin{quote}\textit{Would it be possible to create a ``GitHub for education?'' Right now, I think the answer is ``no'', because today's learning content formats make merging hard. Whatever a ``GitHub for education'' would look like, it would not be yet another repository of open learning materials. There are lots of those already, but almost all their content is write-once-and-upload, \ldots rather than sharing course content in a reusable, remixable way.}\end{quote}

In 2012, he elaborated on this, describing what this work alludes to as ``The GitHub Way''\footnote{\url{http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2012/04/github-for-education.html}}:

\begin{quote}\textit{``GitHub for Education'' isn’t necessarily, ``Let’s put educational materials in GitHub'', but rather, ``Let’s facilitate a culture of spontaneous-but-structured collaboration and improvement.''}\end{quote}

%rewrite
Wilson recognized the limitations of the majority of learning management systems in the difficulty for instructors trying to reuse and share materials. This is the type of problem that the software development community had already solved using tools such as GitHub. This brings into question whether such tools originally built for software developers have their place in other fields that have similar needs such as education.

% Software Developers did a bunch of things first
%look up more stuff here
Consequently, software developers are sometimes described as the ``prototype of the future knowledge worker'', as they are often the first to adopt new tools and new techniques\footnote{\url{http://allankelly.blogspot.ca/2014/04/the-prototype-of-future-knowledge.html}}. Because software developers and programmers are able to create and change products to meet their needs, they more often than not turn out to be the early adopters of tools that other fields go on to use. This is evident in examples such as e-mail, the web, and wikis: tools that were invented by and often used for work by programmers, which later became significant tools in other fields.

% Always on learning
Moreover, programmers and software developers experience `always-on' learning, where they constantly have access to learning materials and content relevant in their field. In software development, knowledge is constantly evolving and developers often have to stay current with languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools. Unfortunately, courses are more often than not self-contained, with little input or output to and from outside software development communities. This could potentially be addressed using tools in which users can interface with other communities and groups beyond the classroom.

\section{Research Questions}
This thesis aims to explore tools in computer science and software engineering education, particularly the use of a tool such as GitHub and its effectiveness in that context. The research questions involved are therefore exploratory, and they are: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the \emph{current landscape} of tools used for Computer Science \& Software Engineering education and what needs are not being met?
\item Is the \emph{`GitHub Way'} a viable approach to education of Computer Science and Software Engineering students and how does it \emph{compare} to traditional learning tools?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the benefits and weaknesses to this approach from an \emph{instructor's perspective}?
    \item What are the benefits and weaknesses to this approach from the \emph{student's perspective}?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Approach}
%exploratory - justify!
I approached my research questions with a constructivist approach, where I would seek to construct knowledge and theories, relying mainly on participants' views \cite{easterbrook2008selecting}. A constructivist approach, according to Easterbrook, does not focus on verifying theories, but instead seeks to understand how people make sense of the world, and might build theories based on the context being studied. In this work, my goal was to seek student and instructor perspectives on the use of GitHub in an educational context. Based on these perspectives, it can be determined whether or not `The GitHub Way' is a viable approach to education, which can influence the development of tools focused on computer science and software engineering education.

%more on social constructivism/constructivism? from student/teacher perspective?

My first research question was addressed through a thorough literature search, where I look at work regarding computer science and software engineering education, tools used in education in general, and the landscape of tools specifically for use in these technical fields. This review also includes literature surrounding GitHub and similar Distributed Version Control Systems (DCVS), particularly exploring their collaborative features and describing other instances in which they have been used in an educational context. In searching for literature, I focused on educational tools, exploring what researchers believe typical LMSes lack and how those limitations can be addressed.

The second research question is then addressed in two different studies - one involving instructors as participants and another involving two courses as a case study with multiple cases. In both studies, the research methods used were congruent with exploratory research, as we sought to explore the perspectives of instructors and students on the use of GitHub as a platform for education. In this thesis, both studies will be described in separate sections, and the research methodology will be explained in more detail within each section.

\section{Thesis Organization}
This section served to introduce the work done, summarizing the problem that was addressed, the research questions that were explored, and how I approached the research. The rest of this thesis is organized as follows:

In Chapter 2, the related work is summarized, including literature on Computer Science and Software Engineering education, on learning tools, and on student engagement. The aim of this chapter is to elaborate on where this research fits into the surrounding literature.
%do we talk FOCUS GROUPS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

In Chapter 3, the `GitHub Way' is discussed further, where the features of GitHub are described in greater detail, including the possibilities for application to education. The aim of the chapter is to provide an overview of how GitHub might fit into the educational landscape.

In Chapter 4, I describe a study conducted in which educators who were early adopters of using GitHub for Education were interviewed. The aim of the study was to explore how and why educators used GitHub for their courses, including the benefits and challenges they experienced relating to the use of the tool.

%in which GitHub was used as a learning platform? as an LMS?
In Chapter 5, I describe a study conducted in which GitHub was used for the courses in two courses in the University of Victoria. The aim of the study was to explore the student perspective regarding what they believed to be the benefits and challenges of using such a platform for their courses. The study also aimed to identify what workflows students believed would best fit the use of a platform like GitHub.

In Chapter 6, I discuss the relevance of the work done and the implications on courses and on learning tools. I also describe some recommendations for possible uses of GitHub in an educational context, as well as potential changes that may be considered for the development of a educationally-focused tool that utilizes the `GitHub Way'.

In Chapter 7, I outline possible future work and conclude the thesis by discussing how my research questions were addressed. Additional documents are found in the Appendices, including the interview questions for both studies.
