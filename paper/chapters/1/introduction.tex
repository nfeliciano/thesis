\section{Introduction}

An important goal of computer science and software engineering education is to prepare students well for their future careers in industry. As many software projects today are increasingly collaborative, such as those in globally developed projects or open-source projects, it becomes necessary for educators to prepare their students well for a career in this environment. Yet, the concept of group and collaboration skills has been discussed by many researchers and educators, with assertions that students are generally not well-prepared with group work skills [cite Waite et al.].

While many are making adjustments to their curricula to account for this [cite Jayazeri, cite Coleman & Lang], another area worth investigation is the use of tools in computer science and software engineering education. Extending to other disciplines, web-based learning tools sees regular use in education as the main portal for students to engage with the course and its participants. Therefore these tools, which are traditionally Learning Management Systems (LMS), has the potential to serve an important point of interaction between not just the students and educators, but between the students themselves [cite Minds on Fire?].

..More on LMS and Web-based Learning Tools, maybe Mei Wang's work or more recent paper?

..Tools can enable collaboration that educators can utilize for their classroom

..Done in the software development world, which usually serves as early adopters, particularly in education (using wikis, twitter, other social media as example)

..DCVS and GitHub, use in Software Development world

..CS/SE tools in education, what can be addressed
