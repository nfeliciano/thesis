\startappendix{Interview Questions - Instructor Perspective}

This appendix lists the interview questions we used in the study highlighted in Chapter 4. The first section lists the starting set of questions we asked the educators. The interviewer would probe and ask further questions when interesting topics emerged. The second section lists the interview questions used when we spoke to the representative for GitHub.
